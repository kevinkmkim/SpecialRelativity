  dialogueText: "You will notice that the ball has travelled a horizontal distance,
    even though I dropped the ball simply by letting go of it. \nThis is because
    the train is moving, and the ball moves together with the train. \nIf we assume
    that there is no air resistance, you can see that the ball has travelled exactly
    the same horizontal distance as the train \u2013 it is right below where I am
    standing on the train!\nFrom our point of view on the platform, the ball has
    a horizontal velocity matching the train: we can call this perspective the \u201Cplatform
    frame of reference\u201D.\nLet\u2019s put some numbers to the situation. Say
    the ball travelled 2 meters horizontally and it took 1 second to hit the ground."
