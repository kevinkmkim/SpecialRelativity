  dialogueText: Yes, we did say that there can only be one physical reality. Since
    the gates did not hit the train from the platform frame, then they must not have
    hit the train in the train frame. But how exactly does that happen?
  choices:
  - choiceText: It is possibly because the train can phase through the gates when
      it is travelling at high speeds.

    isCorrectChoice: 0
  - choiceText: Maybe the gates are closing at different times in the train frame
      of reference.

  - choiceText: Perhaps there are two possible realities because quantum superposition
      allows both things to happen at once.

  - choiceText: I change my mind, I think the gates will hit the train in the train
      frame of reference.

  - choiceText: I think there is some other explanation for this.
