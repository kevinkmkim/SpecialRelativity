  dialogueText: "Perhaps surprisingly, special relativity does not require much background
    knowledge or mathematics to understand, and I intend to take things step by step.\nTo

    of reference,\u201D which basically refers to different perspectives that you
    can observe the world from. \nLet me show you what I mean. \nLet\u2019s imagine
    that I am on a train moving past the platform at a constant speed, and as the
    train passes by the platform, I drop a ball that I am holding."
