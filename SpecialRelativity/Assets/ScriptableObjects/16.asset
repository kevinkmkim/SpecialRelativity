  dialogueText: "This is because the laws of physics are the same in every non-accelerating
    frame of reference. Regardless of the velocity, if I drop a ball, it falls straight
    down. \nIn fact, no other physics experiments I can conduct will allow me to
    determine what velocity we are travelling at. \nAnother point you might find
    interesting is that the speed of light remains the same regardless of the frame
    of reference."
