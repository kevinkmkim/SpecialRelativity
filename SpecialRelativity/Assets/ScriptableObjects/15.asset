  dialogueText: "This may seem strange, but now that we are on the train and moving
    together with it, we no longer perceive the train to be moving. \nInstead, we
    can say that it is the platform and even the whole world around us that is moving,
    while the train stays completely still.\nThe key idea here is that velocity is
    relative! When you are measuring velocity, you are always measuring it with respect
    to a specific frame of reference. \nFurthermore, there is no preferred frame
    of reference. In other words, there is no single absolute answer for the velocity
    of an object.\nYou may think otherwise. After all, the train is clearly moving
    at a velocity of 2m/s, and the only reason we perceive it to not be moving right
    now is an illusion created by the fact that we are moving together with the train.\nHowever,
    if I removed the platform and everything else, then you will find that it is
    impossible to tell what velocity the train is moving at!"
