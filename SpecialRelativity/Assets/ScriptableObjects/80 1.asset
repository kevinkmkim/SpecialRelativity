  dialogueText: Oh? How exactly does that happen?
  choices:
  - choiceText: It is possibly because the train can phase through the gates when
      it is travelling at high speeds.

    isCorrectChoice: 0
  - choiceText: Maybe the gates are closing at different times in the train frame
      of reference.

  - choiceText: Perhaps there are two possible realities because quantum superposition
      allows both things to happen at once.

  - choiceText: I change my mind, I think the gates will hit the train in the train
      frame of reference.
